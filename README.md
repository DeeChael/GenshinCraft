# GenshinCraft
Playing Genshin Impact on paper and velocity based server

**Attention**: This project is original public for any server so that everyone can set up a genshin impact minecraft server. However, I found it very difficult. So this project is only open-to-use on my server, you have to change the source code if you want to build a genshin impact server!

Some of the libraries used in this project from:\
https://github.com/DeeChael \
https://github.com/GedStudio \
https://github.com/opencraft-mc \
Especially from https://github.com/opencraft-mc/PlutoMC whose maintainers contain me
